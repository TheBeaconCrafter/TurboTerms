# TurboTerms

**TurboTerms is a powerful vocabulary learning web application that helps you enhance your language skills through interactive quizzes.**

Have you ever wanted to selfhost a vocabulary learning application? Most likely not, but for those of you that do: TurboTerms is for you!


TurboTerms is free to use on my public instance or you can selfhost it. It does not use much processing power of your server, as it is caching almost everything and doing most things on client-side, which is also faster. There is a TurboTerms server, which is not yet opensource. You can just disable that functionality though. TurboTerms was created to support students that don't want to pay for learning tools.
